--------------------------------------------------------------

1. Create an IAM role named SSM-EC2 for the EC2 service by using the AmazonEC2RoleforSSM policy.

2. Create Key-pair for EC2 (i.e WebServerKeyPair)

5. Attach the SSM-EC2 role to each of the running WebServer instances.

6. Restart both instances.

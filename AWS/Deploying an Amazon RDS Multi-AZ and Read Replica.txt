Deploying an Amazon RDS Multi-AZ and Read Replica
====================================================
Introduction
In this hands-on lab, we will work with Relational Database Service (RDS). This lab will provide you with hands-on experience with:

Enabling Multi-AZ and backups
Creating a read replica
Promoting a read replica
Updating the RDS endpoint in Route 53
Multi-AZ is strictly for failover, as the standby instances cannot be read from by an application.
 Read replicas are used for improved performance and migrations. With read replicas, you can write to the primary database and 
read from the read replica. Because a read replica can be promoted to be the primary database, it makes for a great tool in 
disaster recovery and migrations.

Solution
------------

Log in to the live AWS environment using the credentials provided. Make sure you're in the N. Virginia (us-east-1) region throughout the lab.

Enable Multi-AZ Deployment
Navigate to EC2 > Load Balancers.
Copy the DNS name of the load balancer.
Open a new browser tab, and enter the DNS name.
We will use this web page to test failovers and promotions in this lab.
Back in the AWS console, navigate to RDS > Databases.
Click on our database instance.
Click Modify.

Under Multi-AZ deployment, click Create a standby instance (recommended for production usage).
Use a burstable class db.t3.micro instance.
Click continue at the bottom of the page.
Under Scheduling of modifications, select Apply immediately, and then click Modify DB Instance.

Once the instance shows Multi-AZ status as Available (it could take about
10 minutes), select the database instance.
Click Actions > Reboot.
On the reboot page, select Reboot With Failover?, and click Confirm.

Create a Read Replica
With the database instance still selected, click Actions > Create read replica.
For Destination region, select US East (N. Virginia).
In the Settings section, under DB instance identifier, enter "wordpress-rr".
Leave the other defaults, and click Create read replica. It will take a few minutes for it to become available.
Refresh the web page we navigated to earlier to see if our application is still there. It should be fine.

Promote the Read Replica and Change the CNAME Records Set in Route 53 to the New Endpoint
Once the read replica is available, check the circle next to it.

Click Actions > Promote.
Leave the defaults, and click Continue, and then click Promote Read Replica.
Use the web page to monitor for downtime.
Once the read replica is available, click to view it.
In the Connectivity & security section, copy the endpoint.
Navigate to Route 53 > Hosted zones.
Select the private hosted zone.
Select the db.mydomain.local record.
Click Edit.
Leave the Record name as db.
Replace what's currently in the Value box with the endpoint you copied.
Set the TTL to 60 seconds.
Click Save changes.

Monitor using the web page for downtime. (There shouldn't be any.)
Conclusion
Congratulations on completing this hands-on lab!
